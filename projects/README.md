# 🔬 Computer Vision & Deep Learning Portfolio

This directory showcases my major independent projects focused on applying modern deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems in Computer Vision, with an emphasis on production-ready code and performance using PyTorch and Rust integrations.

<!-- ### 🗂️ Project Index

| Project Name | Problem Solved | Key Technologies & Performance Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Surface Defect Classifier](./defect_classifier/README.md)** | Identified and classified five types of surface defects (scratches, cracks, etc.) in metallic parts. | PyTorch, ResNet-50, **Polars** for fast data preprocessing, Automated MLflow tracking. |
| **[Real-Time Object Tracker](./object_tracker/README.md)** | Developed a lightweight tracking algorithm for counting parts moving on a conveyor belt. | YOLOv7 (PyTorch), **Rust/PyO3** integration for high-performance bounding box IOU calculation. |
| **[Synthetic Data Generator](./synthetic_data_gen/README.md)** | Created a pipeline to generate synthetic image data to mitigate data scarcity for uncommon defects. | Python, OpenCV, Blender (for rendering), CI/CD pipeline for dataset versioning. |
